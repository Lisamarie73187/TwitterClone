# TALKO
 We created TALKO with heavy inspiration from Twitter (is meant to be a twitter clone). We added a few tweaks here and there.

 ## Why?
 TALKO is our group project for DevMountain's first cohort in Phoenix.

 ## How?
 We used many technologies for this project including: React | Redux | JavaScript(ES6) | CSS | Sass | Node | Express | Massive | PostgreSQL | Bcrypt | Axios | Jest.

 In the historic words of George Washington:
 > I do believe with all my heart, that Talko is the greatest social media platform of all tiime
